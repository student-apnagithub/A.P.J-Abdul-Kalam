                <h2>Missile man of India</h2>
                <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b>was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim 
                    family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras 
                    Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a
                    boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.
                    His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the
                    now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.<br>
                    Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.
                    His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties 
                    and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu
                    and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business
                    had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri
                    Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of
                    the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family 
                    fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home.
                    The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to 
                    sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income</p>
